A fully free, open-source starter kit for a **Unified Digital Health Record** with an **offline-first** mindset.
Focuses on local processing, privacy, and zero-cost stack choices.

## Highlights
- FastAPI backend with SQLite (local-first)
- Gradio demo app for Hugging Face Spaces
- React + Vite frontend with offline PWA skeleton
- JWT auth (no external auth dependency)
- Optional local AI hooks (Hugging Face transformers)
- Minimal, auditable codebase

See `docs/FREE_SETUP.md` and `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for quick start and endpoints.
